Think of this as my little Python notebook. As I work through my learnings, I like to type out (and even play with) the material to ensure I properly understand it before moving on to the next topic.

I am aware that there are multiple resources (cheat sheets) to my disposal, but I prefer to do these notes in a way that I understand best.

If you do decide to go on the chaotic journey of viewing my learning code, keep in mind that it is not meant to be user friendly, only Dani friendly. It's only purpose is for me to understand what is going on and how certian functions work when I need to quickly check back and review material.
